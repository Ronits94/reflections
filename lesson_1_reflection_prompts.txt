How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
  These commands show the what are changes has been done in two file with conflicts
  and who has been done show their keys to what to add and what to remove data
  from file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  yes  it make sense if i have a revision history so i can sure that i have
  a backup and continue code if i fails that time i can use history to recover

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  I think Google docs is also best it also store history and we can revert
  any changes  and in git we will try out some thing if we neede that this
  changes is required then only we commit but in google doccs it stores every
  seconds so git is best for programming and for writing a stories  google
  docs is best where google docs also store deleted content in his history

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

yes in git its allows to commit multiple files in one commit where its show
what to add and what to remove its also show how many insertion has been done
it shows different changes in different file
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

we can use git log to see how many changes and commit has been done with
 different users
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
